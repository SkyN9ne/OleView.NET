## OleView.NET

OleViewDotNet is a .NET 4 tool which merges the classic ``OleView`` and ``Test Container`` tools.
It allows you to find COM objects through a number of different views (e.g. by ``CLSID``, by ``ProgID``, by server executable), enumerate interfaces on the object and then create an instance and invoke methods. 

It also has a basic container to attack ``ActiveX`` objects to so you can see the display output while manipulating the data.
